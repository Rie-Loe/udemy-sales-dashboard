### Project description
This project centers on data visualization, which aims to reveal hidden insights within various Udemy course topics such as Business, Web Development, Music, and Graphics Design. The objective is to analyze the courses' performance and identify opportunities for revenue growth. 

_*Note #1: I will be working on a more comprehensive article that focuses on the challenges I've encountered and the workarounds I implemented to overcome them in this project._ <br><br>

### Tasks performed 
##### 1. Data Cleaning
##### Tools required: Microsoft Excel, Jupyter Notebook
Since the dataset exists in the form of .csv files, I have performed basic preprocessing steps such as data deduplication, extracting date from timestamp column, column creation/deletion etc. on Microsoft Excel. I made use of Jupyter Notebook to take a closer look at any abnormal values I came across on Microsoft Excel before performing further data cleaning. <br><br>

##### 2. Data Manipulation
##### Tools required: Microsoft SQL Server
All preprocessed data will be imported into Microsoft SQL Server. Some data manipulation operations I have performed include changing data types, renaming columns and merging all imported datasets into a single table. This final dataset will be the primary data source when I work in Microsoft Power BI.  <br><br>

##### 3. Data Aggregation and Data Visualisation
##### Tools required: Microsoft Power BI
I made use of DAX formulas to aggregate data and present useful metrics in the form of cards and slicers. <br><br>
